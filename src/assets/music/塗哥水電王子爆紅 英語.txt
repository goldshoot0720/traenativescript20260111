The Beginning 
 On June 15, 2004, this day marks when junior high school graduates could leave commemorative signatures in their yearbook, and it was also the beginning of everything for our story's protagonist, Tu Shen: Tu Sanjie, later known as Tu Ge. 
 
 Conversation at Taichung Snack Shop 
 Tu Ge was at a small snack shop in Taichung. His companion, Tong Xing (known as Tu Ge's master, same surname and name), pointed at the TV and mentioned the outbreak of the Sunflower Movement in Taipei. Tu Ge replied, "I don't understand politics; let's go buy some sun cakes." He heard from Feng Xiong that Changhua is abundant in sunflowers, and next month they planned a day trip to a farm in Changhua. Tong's occupational habits kicked in, discoursing expertly on farm construction. 
 
 Feng Xiong's Little History Class 
 Lin, the apprentice, said AI robots might replace electricians. "I'm so anxious," Lin said. Tu Ge reassured, "But I heard Feng Xiong say that's the future, not now. First, let's focus on our work at hand: take life one step at a time." 
 
 The Deputy Mayor Classmate 
 Tu Ge mentioned having a classmate who serves as deputy mayor in Taipei. Tong replied, "Are you talking about Feng Xiong?" "Feng Xiong?! That's impossible. Feng Xiong is now the regional manager of a green papaya drink franchise. The deputy mayor is Huang Xingfeng," Tong said. "I thought it was Feng Xiong; they both have 'Feng' in their names. Anyway, is your classmate not running for mayor?" Tu Ge said, "My classmate wrote a book about electricians that sold over 2.5 million copies, so he has the capability to run for office." 
 
 Zoo Flash Mob 
 Someone did a flash mob at the Taipei Zoo, singing about the zoo's wonders. "Shin-chan?!" Tu Ge said, "I don't speak Japanese; let's head to the KTV to sing 'Paradise'." 
 
 TV Drama Craze 
 Chairman Tu, have you been watching the recent hit drama? 'The Love of an Electrician?!' I heard it's based on Tu Weijie's true story. "Tu Weijie?! My name is Tu Sanjie, just one character off; he might be my distant relative. Really? Your Tu family dominating the electrician industry is outrageous!" 
 
 Phenomenal Success 
 Chairman Tu, do you know Tu Weijie's fame reached the point of being included in vocational school literature textbooks? "Holy moly, Tu Weijie must be my distant relative. Shocked like a cat. Even Feng Xiong's cat would be shocked!"
