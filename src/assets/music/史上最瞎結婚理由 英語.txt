Intro 
 Brother Feng, are you serious or joking? 
 Brother Tu is laughing so hard 
 
 Verse 1 
 Brother Feng says there's only one reason to marry 
 On the day of the lottery draw 
 The winning numbers were given by Simin 
 Watching the jackpot fall, his heart was captured too 
 
 Chorus 
 The most ridiculous reason to marry 
 The lottery brought them together so strong 
 One Simin, one Huixuan 
 Both won the jackpot with their numbers 
 
 Outro 
 Brother Feng with Simin, Brother Tu with Huixuan 
 Wedding guests laughing at these two stories 
 Most ridiculous marriage reasons turned into jackpots 
 If happiness can be this absurd 
 Then I'll buy a ticket tomorrow too
